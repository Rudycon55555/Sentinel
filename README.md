Sentinel
========

A modular, secure, full‑stack system‑development framework built in Rust.

Sentinel gives developers a clean architecture for building complete system applications with a powerful Frontend, a flexible Backend, and a security‑focused Middlend.  
It is designed for clarity, extensibility, and developer experience.

What Is Sentinel?
-----------------

Sentinel is a framework that helps you build:

• Desktop system applications  
• Secure multi‑window interfaces  
• Role‑based dashboards  
• Data‑driven tools  
• Modular backend engines  
• Extensible middleware pipelines  
• Cryptographically‑safe authentication systems

It combines Rust’s safety with Tauri’s UI capabilities and Sentinel’s own structured architecture.

Project Structure
-----------------

A Sentinel project follows a clear, predictable layout:

• Frontend — GUI, windows, events, scripting  
• Backend — authentication, data handling, cryptography, work engine  
• Middlend — security, middleware, validation, runtime, extensions  
• Describe — configs and metadata  
• Pages — windows, screens, templates  
• APIs — backend endpoints  
• Work — developer backend logic

This structure is enforced and validated by the Middlend layer.

Key Features
------------

Sentinel includes:

• GUI system with reusable components  
• Window builder and event system  
• Secure JS bridge  
• Authentication with Argon2id, SHA‑256, AES‑256  
• JSON, YAML, XML, and SQL data handling  
• Role‑based view resolution  
• Security middleware and runtime engine  
• Extension system for custom behaviors  
• Installer for easy project setup
